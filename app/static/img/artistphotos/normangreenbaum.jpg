 <p>2.2 When you interact with the Services, certain information about your use of the Services is automatically collected, regardless of whether you create an account on the Services.

 <p>2.4 Among the third party cookies used for purposes of optimizing the Services is Google Analytics, a web analytics service provided by Google, Inc.

The technologies used by Google may collect information such as your IP address, time of visit, whether you are a return visitor, and any referring website. The Services do not use Google Analytics to gather information that personally identifies you. The information generated by Google Analytics will be transmitted to and stored by Google and will be subject to Google&#x2019;s <a href="https://policies.google.com/technologies/partner-sites">privacy policies</a>.

 <h3 id="third-parties">4. Sharing Information With Third Parties</h3>
 <p>4.1 We may share the information collected via our Services with third parties who work on our behalf to help us further the purposes described above. We may provide additional information that we have collected about you both directly and automatically to these third parties.</p>
 <p>4.2 We share information about you with third parties who partner with us to provide advertisements about products and services that may be of interest to you. This may include third parties who assist us in identifying which ads to deliver and third parties who deliver the advertisements.  As described above, our third party partners may use persistent identifiers to track your Internet usage across other websites, online services, email and mobile applications in their networks beyond the Services, and may combine information about you from other sources.  We may provide additional information that we have collected about you both directly and automatically to our partners.<br>
Our partners may use the information collected to serve you with targeted advertising, both through our Services and other websites, email, online services or mobile applications. We may also contribute to or participate in cooperative databases, which give other companies access to your information. For more information regarding the partners with whom we share data, please see our <a href="/gdpr/partners/">Partners List.</a></p>
 <p>We adhere to the principles of the Digital Advertising Alliance&#x2019;s Self-Regulatory Principles for Online Behavioral Advertising and Multi-Site Data and the Network Advertising Initiative&#x2019;s Code of Conduct, as applicable. See the Opt-Out section (below) to learn about choices available to you with respect to this type of advertising. </p>
 <p>4.3 We may aggregate your information into a form where individuals can no longer be identified. Given the aggregated, de-identified information, there are no restrictions under this Privacy Policy on how we may use or disclose such information. For example, we may freely share such information with third parties who may use such data for their own marketing, advertising, research, or other business purposes.</p>
 <p>4.4 If you choose to enter a sweepstakes, contest or other promotion, your information may be disclosed to third parties who help design, administer and implement the promotion, including in connection with winner selection, prize fulfillment and aggregated data analysis. Your information also may be disclosed as required by law, such as on a winners list.</p>
 <p>4.5 We may provide products or services jointly with or through certain third-party businesses, including but not limited to retail businesses. When we provide these products or services, we may give you the opportunity to opt-in to the additional sharing of information with these businesses. Should you choose to do so, information you provide specifically in connection with those products and services may be shared with these businesses and subject to their privacy policies.</p>
 <p>4.6 The Services may allow users to post comments and other content to the Services. Any information about yourself that you post to the Services will become public information and will be accessible by other users of the Services. In addition, your user name will be viewable by other users, along with a profile picture if you have chosen to upload one.  We have no responsibility to maintain the privacy or security of any such information that you may choose to post to the Services. </p>

Registered users may choose not to receive text messages from us by not providing us their cell phone number. You can also cancel the SMS service at any time by replying &#x2018;STOP&#x2019; via text. Please note that standard message rates and data charges from your cellular service provider apply to sending and/or receiving text messages. You are solely responsible for such message rates and data charges. </p>
 <p>4.9 We may disclose information about you if required to do so by law or on the good-faith believe that such sharing is necessary to (a) conform to applicable law or comply with legal process served on us or our Services; (b) protect and defend our rights or property, the Services, or our users; or (c) act to protect the personal safety of our employees and agents, other users of the Services, or members of the public.</p>
 <p>4.10 If we go through a business transition, such as a merger, acquisition by another company or a financing, investment, support or funding, sharing or sale of all or a portion of our assets, your information may be among the assets shared or transferred. We cannot promise that an acquiring party or the merged entity will have the same privacy practices or treat your information the same as described in this Privacy Policy.</p>
 <h3 id="security">5. Your Security</h3>
 <p>5.1 We strive to keep your information private and safe. We take commercially reasonable physical, electronic and administrative steps to maintain the security of the information collected. Unfortunately, despite our best efforts, the transmission of data over the Internet cannot be guaranteed to be 100% secure.  Please note that e-mail is not encrypted and is not considered to be a secure means of transmitting credit card information, so please do not send us your credit card number by email. Any payment transactions will be encrypted. </p>
 <h3 id="options">6. Your Options</h3>

 <p>6.4 Please note that opting-out of advertising networks services does not mean that you will not receive advertising while using our Services or on other Services, nor will it prevent the receipt of interest-based advertising from third parties that do not participate in these programs. It will, however, exclude you from interest-based advertising conducted through participating networks, as provided by their policies and choice mechanisms.  If you delete your cookies, you may also delete your opt-out preferences. If you use multiple browsers or devices you may need to execute this opt out on each browser or device.</p>

 <p>6.7 You may update or delete information from your profile at any time, or request that we do so; however, because we archive past transactions, you cannot delete this information. You may also request that we delete your account entirely by contacting us. Terminating your registration will not necessarily remove previous public comments or other user content on public display on the Services. If you wish to cancel your account on the Services or delete your information previously provided to us, you may send your request here:  <a href="http://ultimateclassicrock.com/privacy/preferences" rel="nofollow">http://ultimateclassicrock.com/privacy/preferences</a>.</p>
